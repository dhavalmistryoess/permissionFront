Parents do have certain rights over minor children’s information.  Parents may review their child’s Personal Information, direct their child’s school or district to delete it, and refuse to allow any further collection or use of the child’s information.  Parents also have the option to allow for the collection and use of their child’s information, but still restrict disclosure to third parties. Because the Personal Information entrusted to us are under the direct control of the originating school, district, or educational organization, if parents would like to exercise any of the above-mentioned rights, a parent should directly contact their children’s school or district. Should a school or district like to exercise any of the above-mentioned rights, please contact us at <a href="mailto:Policies@TheOpenEyes.com">Policies@TheOpenEyes.com</a>. </p>
